"""Map players from broadcast frames onto the 2D rink template using a per-frame homography.

Pipeline per frame:
    1. match_keypoints()   work out which rink landmark each dot / circle / line / goal detection is
    2. compute_homography() fit image pixels -> rink feet, dropping outlier matches
    3. HomographyTracker   smooth H over time and bridge frames with too few landmarks
    4. project_players()   map each player's skate position (and the puck) onto the rink

Run on an existing run_models.py output:
    python homography.py outputs/<clip>/detections.json videos/<clip>.mp4
This writes, next to the detections file:
    side_by_side.mp4  the original video, unannotated, with the top-down rink view beside it
    positions.json    per frame: the homography, keypoints used, and player / puck rink positions
    positions.csv     one row per player or puck per frame: rink x, y in feet (and jersey number)
    homographies.csv  one row per frame: the 3x3 image -> rink homography, h00..h22 (empty if no fit)
With --no-video the video is skipped. With --debug it also writes radar.mp4 (top-down view with
the keypoints the fit used) and overlay.mp4 (rink keypoints reprojected onto the video, to check
the fit).

A homography row maps a video pixel (u, v) to rink feet: [x, y, w] = H @ [u, v, 1], then
(x / w, y / w). Rink feet have the origin at the centre dot, x along the rink (-100 to 100) and
y across it (-42.5 near boards to 42.5 far boards); see rink.py.

The top-down view shows players (with their jersey numbers, when run_models.py read them) and
the puck. On frames with no usable fit, including fits rejected because they put all the
players in a tiny patch or make them implausibly tall or short, the rink is shown empty with
its outline in red.
