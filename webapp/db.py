"""The web app's SQLite database: every NHL player (from the roster CSVs), the games imported from
export_data.py outputs with each player's stats, favourites and playlists.

    players          one row per NHL player, keyed by the NHL's player_id
    games            one row per imported game (an export folder)
    game_stats       one row per player per game: role, team and the player_stats.csv row as JSON
    favorites        starred players
    playlists        named lists of players; a pool is a playlist with is_pool set and roster slots
    playlist_players the players in each playlist

From the NHL's API (nhl.py), refreshed by `python -m webapp.nhl sync`:

    players          also each player's headshot and bio, from the current rosters, and on_roster:
                     1 on a current NHL roster, 0 not (sent down, waived), NULL not checked yet
    nhl_standings    one row per team: record, points, streak, division rank
    nhl_season_stats one row per player: this season's official totals
    nhl_schedule     one row per scheduled NHL game
    nhl_boxscores    official box scores of imported games, and nhl_boxscore_lines one row per player
    nhl_player_landing  each player's NHL page (last 5 games, draft, career), cached when opened
    nhl_sync         when each kind of NHL data was last refreshed, and whether it worked
