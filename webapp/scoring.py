"""Hockey-Vision scores: how well a player played in one game (0-100), their form over recent games,
whether a pool should keep or trade them, and how strong a pool is overall.

Everything here is a pure function of a player's player_stats.csv row (export_data.py, the video)
and their official box score line (nhl.py), so the rules can be read and tuned in one place.

Game score
    Built from up to three parts, depending on what the game has:

    play      from the video: movement, possession, pass quality and pressure (PLAY_WEIGHTS: a
              takeaway +2, a good pass +1, a turnover -2, ...). Broadcast video only shows each
              player some of the time, so the points become a rate per minute detected, shrunk
              towards the league's typical rate (SHRINK_MINUTES) so 20 seconds on screen can't
              decide a game.
    results   from the NHL's box score: goals, assists, shots on goal, +/-, hits, blocks, penalty
              minutes (RESULT_WEIGHTS); goalies saves, goals against, the win, shutouts.
    backed    plays the video shows behind an official result, in the same game (SYNERGY): assists
              in a game the video saw good passes, goals it saw the shots for, points after it saw
              the player win the puck, a plus backed by defensive plays; and turnovers in a minus
              game count against.

    Each part is compared with every other player-game in the database of the same role: the
    video rates by median and spread, the results by where the game ranks among them (a
    percentile, since a few multi-point nights would swamp a spread). Until the database has
    enough games (MIN_CALIBRATION_ROWS, MIN_RESULT_ROWS) it uses DEFAULT_CALIBRATION, the results
    part measured on 100 of the 2026-27 season's NHL box scores. The two are blended (W_PLAY,
    W_RESULT; the play part counts less when the player was barely on screen). With no box score the score is the video alone, with
    shots and possible goals in place of the official results (VIDEO_WEIGHTS); with no video row
    (a player whose number was never read) it is the results alone. The blend is mapped onto 0-100
    with a logistic curve: 50 is a typical game, 73 one spread better, 88 two.

Form
    A recency-weighted mean of the last FORM_GAMES scores, games with a box score or more time
    detected counting more. Trend is the last 3 games against the ones before them.

Trade call (per pool player)
    hold    fewer than MIN_GAMES games, too early to judge
    trade   form below TRADE_BELOW
    watch   form below WATCH_BELOW, or a trend drop of TREND_DROP or more
    keep    otherwise ("core" from CORE_ABOVE)

Pool assessment
    Strength (mean form of the pool's rated players, graded A-F), depth per position group against
    the pool's slots, trade candidates and the best available upgrades, all folded into a 0-100
    trade urgency and a verdict: hold, make a targeted trade, or be active.
