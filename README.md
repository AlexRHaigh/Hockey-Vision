# Hockey-Vision

Hockey-Vision turns broadcast NHL video into player and puck tracking data and play-by-play
events. It finds every player, referee and the puck in each frame, reads the players' jersey
numbers, works out where each frame's camera is looking on the rink, and maps everyone onto a
top-down rink in real-world feet. From those rink positions it finds possessions, shots, passes,
turnovers and defensive plays. The output is machine-readable data: per-frame and per-player
tables, an event list with times, and a `game_report.json` written for a language model to read
and turn into feedback.

It runs on a Mac or a CUDA GPU, and on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with TensorRT engines (see
[jetson/README.md](jetson/README.md)).

```

1. **Detection and tracking** (`run_models.py`): the player model's boxes are tracked across
   frames, so each player keeps an id. The number model reads digits on each player's torso,
   and every frame's reading votes for that track's number, so the number holds through frames
   where it can't be read. With `--teams`, a roster from `fetch_roster.py` restricts the numbers
   to those each team wears and names the players (`roster.py`).
2. **Rink mapping** (`homography.py`, `rink.py`): the rink and dots models' keypoints are matched
   to known rink landmarks, and a homography from image pixels to rink feet is fitted for each
   frame. Players are placed where their skates meet the ice. Rink coordinates are feet from the
   centre dot: x along the rink (-100 to 100), y across it (-42.5 to 42.5).
3. **Export and play events** (`export_data.py`, `events.py`): one or more clips' outputs become
   tables, play events and per-player stats (see [Output](#output)). Events are found from the
   rink positions alone, in the 2D rink plane.

## Models

The five YOLO models aren't in git; they're on Hugging Face at
[AlexRHaigh/Hockey-Vision](https://huggingface.co/AlexRHaigh/Hockey-Vision) and go in
`CV_Models/Models/`. **[CV_Models/README.md](CV_Models/README.md) lists each model, what it
detects and how to download them.**

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -U huggingface_hub
hf download AlexRHaigh/Hockey-Vision --include "*.pt" --local-dir CV_Models/Models
```

## Running

1. `run_models.py <video>` runs the detection models and writes `outputs/<clip>/detections.json`.
2. `homography.py outputs/<clip>/detections.json <video>` maps players and the puck onto the rink
   (`positions.json`, `positions.csv`, `homographies.csv`).
3. `export_data.py outputs/<clip>` writes the tables, events and `game_report.json` to
   `outputs/<clip>/export/` (several clips: `export_data.py outputs`, written to `outputs/export/`).

`run_models.py --width <px>` (e.g. 640, 960, 1280) resizes the frames before the models see them,
to test how they do on lower-resolution video; the default is the video's own resolution.
Detections are still written in the source video's pixels, so the later steps run unchanged.

`run_models.py --rink-stride 2` runs the rink and dots models only on every other frame (and on
every camera cut), and `homography.py` holds the rink fit in between. This makes `run_models.py`
about 12% faster on a Mac. Players, the puck and jersey numbers stay the same; player rink
positions move by about 0.3-0.5 ft (median). `run_models.py` records camera cuts in
`detections.json`, so `homography.py` only decodes the video when it writes videos.

`jetson/run_clip.sh <video> [--teams SJS MTL]` runs all three. Only data is written by default.
Annotated videos are optional outputs, for checking the models by eye:
`run_models.py --save-video` writes `combined.mp4` (`--per-model` adds one video per model), and
`homography.py --save-video` writes `side_by_side.mp4` with the top-down rink beside the video
(`--debug` adds `radar.mp4` and `overlay.mp4`).

## Output

`outputs/<clip>/export/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `game_report.json` | Everything a language model needs for feedback, in one file: definitions, team totals, each player's stats, and every event with its time and a plain-English `description` |
| `events.csv` | One row per event: `type` (`shot`, `pass`, `turnover`, `defensive_play`), `subtype`, time, who did it, who to/from, rink position, zone; type-specific fields in `details` (JSON) |
| `player_stats.csv` | One row per player: time detected, distance skated, possessions, shots, passes (good ones too), takeaways, interceptions, turnovers, defensive plays |
| `possessions.csv` | One row per spell of a player carrying the puck, and how it ended |
| `players.csv`, `puck.csv`, `frames.csv`, `tracks.csv` | Per-frame positions and per-track summaries ([jetson/README.md](jetson/README.md#exported-tables)) |
| `metadata.json` | Source files, frame rate, coordinate system and a description of every column |

The events (`events.py` has the exact rules and thresholds):

- **Shots**: the puck leaves a player's stick at shot speed on a line at the other team's net, or
  the other team's goalie gets it straight after a release near the net. Outcomes: `saved`,
  `blocked`, `possible_goal`, `rebound_recovered`, `recovered_by_opponent`, `unknown`.
- **Passes**: the puck goes from one player to a teammate. `good` passes say why: advanced the
  puck, beat defenders, relieved pressure, found an open teammate, or led to a shot.
- **Turnovers**: the other team gets the puck: a `takeaway` (stolen off the carrier), an
  `interception`, or a `goalie_recovery`.
- **Defensive plays**: an opponent close to the carrier forces them to backtrack, slows them
  down, or makes them pass the puck away. Credited to that defender.
- **Time detected**: per player, every frame of every track carrying their jersey number.

Which way each team attacks comes from where the goalies stand. Times are video time, not the
game clock. The puck is only seen in part of the frames and players are only named once their
number is read, so treat the counts as estimates.

## Web app

`webapp/` is a web app on top of the exported data: every NHL team's players, a 0-100 score for
each player in each analysed game, favourites, playlists, and hockey pools with trade calls and an
assessment of whether to trade at all. It uses only the Python standard library (SQLite and
`http.server`), so it runs wherever the pipeline does.

```bash
python -m webapp.server                       # http://127.0.0.1:8000 (--host 0.0.0.0 to share it)
python -m webapp.ingest outputs/<clip>/export --roster rosters/2026-03-03_MTL_at_SJS.csv
python -m webapp.demo                         # or: 300 made-up demo games to try it (--clear removes them)
```

- **Overview**: your own setup rather than league totals. For your pool (or any playlist you pick)
  it shows strength, trade urgency, the average of the last game, trend and keep / watch / trade
  counts. It also charts your players' average score per week, lists your top performers and the
  players needing attention (with the best available replacement), compares your form with the
  league median by position, and lists your players' recent games and your favourites.
- **NHL data**: official, up-to-date information from the NHL's public API (documented at
  [gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi), `new-api.md`), refreshed with
  `python -m webapp.nhl sync` or the *Refresh NHL data* button on the overview:
  standings, current rosters (trades and call-ups move players; players on no roster, e.g. sent
  down or waived, are marked *Off roster*, left out of team lists and upgrade suggestions, and
  flagged in pool assessments; headshots, handedness, height, weight, birth date and place), every
  player's season totals (GP, G, A, P, +/-, PIM, PPP, SOG,
  TOI/GP; goalies W, L, OTL, GAA, SV%, SO) and this week's schedule. Player pages also fetch the
  player's last 5 games, draft and career totals when opened, cached for 6 hours. Imported games
  are matched to their NHL game by date and teams (or `webapp.ingest --game-id`) and get the
  official box score, which goes into the game scores (below). The overview adds your pool's NHL
  points, goalie wins and games this week.
- **Players**: all 32 teams from `rosters/nhl_active_players.csv` (refresh with `fetch_roster.py`;
  the server loads it into an empty database, `python -c "from webapp import db; db.load_roster(db.connect())"`
  reloads it). Each player's page has their form, trend, a chart of their game scores, their NHL
  season, and their game log.
- **Imports**: `webapp.ingest` reads an export's `player_stats.csv` and matches players to NHL ids
  by team and jersey number, so the clip must have been run with `--teams`. With `--roster` (the
  `fetch_roster.py --game` file) the game's date and teams come from the roster; otherwise pass
  `--date`, `--away` and `--home`. Importing the same folder again replaces the game.
- **Game score**: the video and the NHL's box score together, in three parts:
  - *Play*, from the video: movement, possession, pass quality and pressure (good pass +1,
    takeaway +2, turnover -2, ...), as points per minute the player was detected, blended with 3
    minutes of typical play so brief appearances can't run away.
  - *Results*, from the box score: goals +6, assists +4, shots on goal, +/-, hits, blocks, penalty
    minutes; goalies saves, goals against, the win and shutouts.
  - *Backed by video*: official results the video saw the player create in the same game count
    extra. That covers an assist when the video saw good passes, a goal when it saw the shots,
    points after it saw the player win the puck, and a plus backed by defensive plays. Turnovers on
    video in a minus game count against. Each result needs its own play on video: 4 good passes
    back at most 4 assists.

  Play is compared with every other player-game in the database, and results by where the game
  ranks among them. Until the database has enough games, results are ranked against 100 of this
  season's real box scores. The two are blended, and play counts less when the player was barely
  on screen: 50 is a typical game, 73 one spread better, 88 two. With no box score yet, the score
  is the video alone (its own shots and saves standing in); players the video never identified are
  scored on their box score alone. The matching is per game, not per play: the video's times
  aren't lined up with the game clock yet. The weights are in `webapp/scoring.py`.
- **Form and trade calls**: form is the last 5 scores, recent and longer-seen games counting more.
  A player is *Trade* below 40 form, *Watch* below 46 or after a 10-point slide, *Keep* otherwise,
  and *Hold* until 3 games are in.
- **Pools**: a playlist marked as a pool, with its league's forward / defense / goalie slots, gets
  a strength grade, depth against the slots, the best available upgrade at each weak spot, and a
  0-100 trade urgency: *hold*, *make a targeted trade*, or *be active*.

The weights and thresholds are all in `webapp/scoring.py`. Scores come from what the video picks
up, so treat them as estimates, like the counts they are built from. The database is
`webapp/hockey_vision.db` (`--db` to use another); there are no user accounts, so everyone who can
reach the server shares the favourites and playlists.

## Jersey numbers

`run_models.py` reads jersey numbers with the YOLO number model, `CV_Models/Models/new_nums.pt` (YOLO26n,
classes `0`-`9`). It detects single digits on each player's box and joins them into the number;
digits outside the torso band (stripes on socks, sticks, the boards) are ignored. Each player
track's readings are combined in a vote, so a number stays with the player through frames where
it can't be read and one-off misreads are outvoted. Referees aren't read.

### Rosters and player names

Give the two teams' abbreviations, team_a's first (the player model's `team_a_player` / `goalie_a`
classes), and jersey numbers are limited to what each team wears, players are named, and referees
get no number:

```bash
python fetch_roster.py                                   # all 32 teams' active rosters -> rosters/nhl_active_players.csv
python run_models.py videos/<clip>.mp4 --teams SJS MTL   # team_a = SJS, team_b = MTL
python fetch_roster.py --game 2025020969                 # a past game: exactly who dressed
python run_models.py videos/<clip>.mp4 --teams SJS MTL --roster rosters/2026-03-03_MTL_at_SJS.csv
```

A reading that isn't a number that team wears is then dropped. `detections.json`, `positions.csv`
and the exported `players.csv` / `tracks.csv` gain `team_abbrev` / `player_name`. The roster CSV has one row per player:
`team, team_name, number, player, position, player_id, as_of`; refetch it as rosters change.

`detections.json` lists the digit boxes in `number`.
